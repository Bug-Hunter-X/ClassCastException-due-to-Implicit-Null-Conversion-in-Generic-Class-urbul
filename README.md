This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Scala related to implicit null conversions in generic classes. The `MyClass` class has an auxiliary constructor that implicitly converts null to the generic type `T`.  This works fine for nullable types like String, but throws a ClassCastException at runtime if `T` is a non-nullable type like Int.  The solution highlights how to avoid this issue by explicitly handling nulls or using a type that supports null values.
